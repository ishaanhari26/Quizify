Welcome to the React Native Boilerplate documentation!
<Tom />

This React Native template project is here to jumpstart your mobile app development journey.
What makes it stand out? Its simplicity, lightweight nature, and scalability.

We've crafted it on a sturdy foundation to ensure easy maintenance, without forcing you into a web of unnecessary dependencies.

Our main goal in designing this boilerplate was to keep things simple and focus on the core principles of React Native,
all while maintaining a clear separation of concerns.

## Dependencies

As previously mentioned, this boilerplate is intentionally designed to be straightforward and lightweight, steering clear of unnecessary dependencies. It relies on the following key dependencies:

- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) (**<VersionReader name="react-native"/>**): Used for building the native app with React.
- [React](https://react.dev/) (**<VersionReader name="react"/>**): Empowers the native app with React.
- [React Native MMKV](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-mmkv) (**<VersionReader name="react-native-mmkv"/>**): A highly efficient and compact mobile key-value storage solution.
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) (**<VersionReader name="@react-navigation/native"/>**): Handles routing and navigation within the app, featuring a default splash screen setup.
- [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) (**<VersionReader name="@tanstack/react-query"/>**): Facilitates data fetching.
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/fr/docs/intro) (**<VersionReader name="axios"/>**): Used for making HTTP requests.
- [React i18next](https://github.com/i18next/react-i18next) (**<VersionReader name="react-i18next"/>**): Manages internationalization within your app.

:::info Just for you
This boilerplate comes complete with an example that demonstrates everything from UI components to business logic, showcasing fake user data. We've made it easy for you to remove this example if it doesn't align with your project requirements, ensuring it won't hinder your progress.
