## How to use ?

The styles generated by the `backgrounds` section of the theme configuration are designed to apply background colors to your components.
To access these styles, you can use the following code:

```javascript
const { backgrounds } = useTheme()
```

## Generated backgrounds

Here is the representation of the generated styles for a given
`BackgroundConfig` like the one below:

```ts title=/src/theme/theme.config.ts
export const config = {
    //...
    backgrounds: {
        [colorName]: colorValue,
        //...
    },
    //...
}
```

The generated styles take the following form:

| background name           | Generated style                     |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| backgrounds._colorName_   | { backgroundColor: _colorValue_ } |

These styles enable you to easily apply background colors to your components as needed.

## Static backgrounds styles
Some background styles, don't require dynamic generation.
To accommodate this, we offer the `staticBackgroundStyles` object that houses static styles for background.
You can use this file as-is or customize it to your preferences.
These styles will be seamlessly merged with the generated ones,
making them accessible through the `backgrounds` object of the `useTheme` hook.

## Playground
Here's a simple playground that provides a visual representation of the objects generated from a given `backgrounds` configuration:

<Backgrounds />
