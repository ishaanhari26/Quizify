The overarching objective of this boilerplate's architecture is to ensure a clear separation of concerns and to harness 
the full potential of React Native. 
To achieve this, the project structure is thoughtfully organized into distinct sections, each serving a specific purpose.

## Atomic Design

The `components` folder follows the [atomic design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) methodology. 
This approach emphasizes modularity and reusability by breaking down elements into atomic components. 
By doing so, development teams can create more consistent, scalable, and maintainable projects.
